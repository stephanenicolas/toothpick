/**
 * <p>
 * A scope is one of the most important concept in ToothPick.
 * It is actually important in Dependency Injection at large and Toothpick
 * exposes it to developers.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Conceptually a scope contains {@link toothpick.config.Binding}s & scoped instances :
 * <dl>
 * <dt>binding</dt>
 * <dd>is way to express that a class {@code Foo} is bound to an implementation {@code Bar}.
 * It means that writing {@code @Inject Foo a;} will return a {@code Bar}. Bindings are valid for the scope where there
 * are defined, and inherited by children scopes. Children scopes can override any binding inherited from of a parent.
 * {@link toothpick.config.Module}s allow to define {@link toothpick.config.Binding}s and are installed in scopes.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>scoped instance</dt>
 * <dd>a scoped instance is an instance that is reused for all injection of a given class.
 * Not all bindings create scoped instances. Bindings {@code Foo} to an instance or to a {@link Provider} instance
 * means that those instances will be recycled every time we inject {@code Foo} from this scope. Scoped instances
 * are all lazily initialized on first injection request.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In toothpick, Scopes create a tree (actually a disjoint forest). Each scope can have children scopes.
 * Operations on the scope tree (adding / removing children, etc.) are non thread safe.
 * The implementation of ToothPick provides a {@code Toothpick} class that wraps these operations in a thread
 * safe way.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Scopes can be associated or bound (not related to binding {@code Foo} to {@code Bar}) to an annotation
 * class that is qualified by the {@link javax.inject.Scope} annotation. All classes annotated by this annotation
 * will automatically be scoped by Toothpick in the scope that is associated to them. Their instances will
 * be recycled in this case.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Classes that are not annotated with a {@link javax.inject.Scope} annotation, also called un-scoped classes,
 * are not associated to a particular scope and can be used in all scopes. Their instances are not recycled,
 * every injection provides a different instance. Scoping a class by annotation is conceptually
 * exactly the same as binding it to itself in a scope.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Scope resolution :
 * when a class is scoped, either by binding it in a module and then installing this module in a scope, or
 * by adding a {@link javax.inject.Scope} annotation, it means that all its dependencies must be found in
 * the scope itself or a parent scope. Otherwise, Toothpick will crash at runtime when first instantiating this
 * class. The only other allowed alternative is to have an un-scoped dependency.
 * </p>
