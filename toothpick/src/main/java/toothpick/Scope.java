/**
 * A scope is one of the most important concept in ToothPick. It is actually important in Dependency
 * Injection at large and Toothpick exposes it to developers.
 *
 * <p>Conceptually a scope contains {@link toothpick.config.Binding}s & scoped instances :
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>binding
 *   <dd>is way to express that a class {@code Foo} is bound to an implementation {@code Bar}. It
 *       means that writing {@code @Inject Foo a;} will return a {@code Bar}. Bindings are valid for
 *       the scope where there are defined, and inherited by children scopes. Children scopes can
 *       override any binding inherited from of a parent. {@link toothpick.config.Module}s allow to
 *       define {@link toothpick.config.Binding}s and are installed in scopes.
 *   <dt>scoped instance
 *   <dd>a scoped instance is an instance that is reused for all injection of a given class. Not all
 *       bindings create scoped instances. Bindings {@code Foo} to an instance or to a {@link
 *       Provider} instance means that those instances will be recycled every time we inject {@code
 *       Foo} from this scope. Scoped instances are all lazily initialized on first injection
 *       request.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>In toothpick, Scopes create a tree (actually a disjoint forest). Each scope can have children
 * scopes. Operations on the scope tree (adding / removing children, etc.) are non thread safe. The
 * implementation of ToothPick provides a {@code Toothpick} class that wraps these operations in a
 * thread safe way.
 *
 * <p>Scopes can support scope annotations : annotation classes qualified by the {@link
 * javax.inject.Scope} annotation. All classes annotated by this annotation will automatically be
 * scoped by Toothpick in a scope that supports them. Scoping a class by annotation is conceptually
 * exactly the same as binding it in this scope.
 *
 * <p>Classes that are not annotated with a {@link javax.inject.Scope} annotation, also called
 * un-scoped classes, are not associated to a particular scope and can be used in all scopes. Their
 * instances are not recycled, every injection provides a different instance. Not scoping a class by
 * annotation is conceptually exactly the same as binding it in every scope.
 *
 * <p>Scope resolution : when a class is scoped, either by binding it in a module and then
 * installing this module in a scope, or by adding a {@link javax.inject.Scope} annotation, it means
 * that all its dependencies must be found in the scope itself or a parent scope. Otherwise,
 * Toothpick will crash at runtime when first instantiating this class. The only other allowed
 * alternative is to have an un-scoped dependency.
